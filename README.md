# Info343FinalProject
Collaborators: Danny Lee, Tessa Vanderwielen, Daniel Merchant

We will be creating a responsive web application, inspired by the Marauder's map from the Harry Potter franchise. Our application will display a map of the University of Washington-- where users can see, in real time, the location of themselves and other signed-in users. Our app will require the user to permit tracking of their location. We intend to stay on theme with Harry Potter's Marauder's Map, displaying each user's location as footprints on the map and eventually including fun features that allow users to hide or distort their location data.

Our project will require Mapbox and Leaflet for our mapping features. We also plan to use Firebase to handle user authentication and to store and retrieve user location data. We will use Material Design Lite as our CSS framework. We anticipate needing additional libraries as we begin implementing the above details.
