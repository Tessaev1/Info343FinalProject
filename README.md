# Info343FinalProject
Collaborative repo for the Info 343 Final Project

Describe what your team is going to build in the README.md file. Include a general description of the project, as well as a list of libraries, frameworks, and/or web services you intend to use.


Collaborators: Danny Lee, Tessa Vanderwielen, Daniel Merchant

We will be creating a responsive web application, inspired by the Marauder's map from the Harry Potter franchise. Our application will display a map of the University of Washington-- where users can see, in real time, the location of themselves and other users. The location of each user will be displayed as footsteps on the map; each user will also be able to see the names of each other user that has given the application permission to do so. 

Libraries, Frameworks, and Services: Mapbox, Leaflet, Material Design Lite, (rest TBD)
